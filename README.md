##WordPress Webpage – How to: Tutorials
My project consists of a website that would allow me to share many video tutorials about certain programming topics that could help others. I started with HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. However, throughout my online research I found out about WordPress and its functionalities and I decided to move my project there instead. I found out that WordPress was an easy tool to create dynamic websites with little or no programming skills. Utilizing WordPress was easy and fast. I was able to create a beautiful webpage in less than 3 hours. Word press has a variety of themes and plugins that can be utilized in seconds. There is no need to code in CSS, MySQL or start the HTML page from scratch, WordPress offers a dashboard where all the built-in features can be accessed.  I've attached screenshots to document the steps I took to create my tutorial website. 
##Original Project
I started my first page using HTML, CSS and MySQL. The idea for my personal webpage was taken from what I have learned in throughout my academic studies.

##Post
The post section allows additions of new products, blogs, highlights, and events to the main page. This is a great feature because anyone accessing the webpage can see what is new.

##Widgets and Plugins
The widgets and plugins feature adds functionality to the webpage. There is a large library of plugins that could help any website to be adjusted to the desired look and need. For instance, search engine, social media and all types of media displays.
